# Light-wave-radar done using arduino

Phototransistor is connected to a servo motor that is spinning and it prints to serial monitor the amount of light it detects. 
Components used: Arduino Uno R3, 10 kohm and 220 ohm resistors, servo motor, 100 uf capacitor, blue led and jumper wires.
Code was run in arduino ide and here is the copy of that code.
